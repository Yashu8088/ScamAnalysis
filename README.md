# Real-Time Analysis of Scams in the Education & IT Sector

This project focuses on understanding how scams operate within the Education and IT sectors, and how they target students, freshers, job seekers, and working professionals. Instead of downloading a ready-made dataset, I manually collected real scam incidents from online articles, news portals, scam-awareness websites, and public reports. These cases were organized into a structured dataset containing details such as scam category, method used, platform, target type, date, and major red-flag indicators.

Once the raw dataset was prepared, I performed cleaning and preprocessing to convert it into a reliable analysis-ready format. Missing values were handled, spelling issues were corrected, duplicate records were removed, and similar scam names were standardized. The cleaned dataset was saved as cleaned_scam_dataset.xlsx, which serves as the main data source for analysis.

Using the Jupyter notebook (Scams.ipynb), I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand scam patterns. The analysis included frequency distributions, category-wise breakdowns, sector comparisons, and trend insights. Through this, I was able to observe key findings such as:

fake job offers and fake course scams are frequent

many scams demand upfront fees or “registration charges”

students and new graduates are commonly targeted

scams often create urgency, fear, or attractive false promises

To make insights easy to interpret, I designed visual dashboards in Power BI using the cleaned dataset. These dashboards highlight how scams vary across sectors, which categories occur most often, and which warning signs commonly appear. Visual representations help users quickly recognize patterns and understand risk areas.

This project is important because online scams continue to rise, and many victims are unaware of how to identify them. By converting real incidents into structured data and analyzing them, this work increases awareness about scam behaviors and provides a foundation for future work such as scam-detection applications or machine-learning models.

Overall, the project demonstrates end-to-end real-world data handling:
data collection → cleaning → analysis → insights → dashboards.
It not only improves technical skills but also contributes toward digital safety and awareness.
